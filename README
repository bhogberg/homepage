This is a simple, django-powered website that I use to administer my lab homepage.

Dependencies: 
    Photologue (http://code.google.com/p/django-photologue)
    PyTextile (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/textile)
    
To use images, add these sizes to Photologue's image sizes: 
'standard'  340px wide
'medium'    220px wide
'small'     100px wide
